# Installation
###   Getting your CI setup ready
To start using GitHb, make sure
 - You have registered for an account using [Link](https://github.com/join)
 - You create your project using reference  [Link](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

To start using Travis CI, make sure you have:
  - A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
  - Owner permissions for a project hosted on GitHub Owner Permissions [Link](https://help.github.com/categories/importing-your-projects-to-github).

To get started with Travis CI, you must:
 - Go to Travis-ci.com and Sign up with GitHub.
 - Accept the Authorization of Travis CI. Youâ€™ll be redirected to GitHub.
 - Click the green Activate button, and select the repositories you want to use with Travis CI.

Final Step would be to download content of this repo including `.travis.yml` file which is a pre-requisit to get your CI setup functional on [travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [Github]([https://github.com/) using [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) service.

Once you are through with above all points without errors, your CI setup should be ready for first commit. [ [reference Link](https://gist.github.com/mindplace/b4b094157d7a3be6afd2c96370d39fad) ]

### Getting your development server ready
To get started using your windows machine for development using this repo, go ahead and install these tools:
  - VirtualBox [Link](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
  - Vagrant [Link](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
  - Mobaxterm (MobaXterm X server and SSH client) [Link](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html)
  - centos/7 CentOS Linux 7 x86_64 Vagrant Box [Link](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/centos/boxes/7)

Create your first project folder and call it `C:\dummyproject\`

Modify VirtualBox Default VM path to `C:\virtualbox-images`

set VAGRANT_HOME to same path as `C:\virtualbox-images`

Follow below steps on Windows Command Prompt or Unix Prompt
```
$ pwd
/drives/d/virtualbox-images
$ vagrant init centos/7
$ vagrant up --provider virtualbox
```
Follow below steps on Mobax Term Console or Unix Prompt
```
$ ssh -p 2222 vagrant@127.0.0.1 -i   /drives/d/virtualbox-images/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key
[vagrant@localhost ~]$ sudo yum install git
[vagrant@localhost ~]$ git clone https://github.com/sandeepspan/integrate.git
[vagrant@localhost ~]$ cd integrate
[vagrant@localhost integrate]$ bash -x bootstrap.sh
```
All installation should be completed without errors if you have reached this step. Now its time to use molecule using docker.
```
[vagrant@localhost integrate]$ cd roles/emoji-app
[vagrant@localhost emoji-app]$ sudo molecule test
[vagrant@localhost emoji-app]$ sudo molecule lint
[vagrant@localhost emoji-app]$ sudo molecule converge
[vagrant@localhost emoji-app]$ sudo molecule destroy

```
